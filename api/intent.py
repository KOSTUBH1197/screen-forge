"""
Intent parsing for operator prompts -- everything we work out about a request
BEFORE any LLM call.

Two questions:
  1. Which machine is the operator talking about? (resolve_asset_id)
     /web offers a "detect machine from request" option that sends
     asset_id: null, and this answers it from the words in the prompt.
  2. Is the operator asking us to CHANGE something rather than watch it?
     (control_request) The MVP is read-only, so such a request must be
     answered with an explanation, not with a quiet monitoring screen.

Deliberately keyword/pattern-based, not model-based: it runs in
microseconds, it never fails open, and when it can't tell it says so
instead of guessing. A wrong guess here would silently build a screen for
the wrong machine, which is worse than asking the operator to name the
asset.
