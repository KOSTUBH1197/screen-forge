Proof that api/intent.py resolves the right machine from a bare prompt.

Run:
    cd api && venv/bin/pytest tests/test_intent.py -q

The cases are written the way an operator types, including the ones that
must NOT resolve: an unresolvable prompt has to return None so /generate can
answer with an "intent" error rather than silently picking a machine.
