"""
Spec generator -- turns an operator's plain-English prompt into a validated
screen specification.

Pipeline:
  1. Retrieve the machine context for the requested asset (dropping "io" --
     see note below).
  2. Build a system prompt containing the rules + 3 golden few-shot examples.
  3. Call the LLM using Structured Outputs (strict JSON-schema mode) so the
     SHAPE of the response is almost guaranteed correct. OpenAI is used when
     OPENAI_API_KEY is set; otherwise Groq's OpenAI-compatible API when
     GROQ_API_KEY is set (see llm_provider()).
  4. Strip null binding fields (strict mode requires every field present,
     so the model emits bind_tag/bind_alarms/bind_device/bind_asset every
     time, three of them null).
  5. Run the cleaned candidate through the real validator (the same one
     used everywhere else -- this function never trusts the LLM's output
     on its own).
  6. If invalid, retry ONCE, appending the validator's error to the prompt
     so the model can see exactly what it got wrong.
  7. If still invalid, give up and return the error. Never return a spec
     that didn't pass validation, no matter how close it looks.

Why "io" is deliberately left out of what the model sees: none of the six
component types bind to raw I/O signals (Emergency_Stop, Door_Switch, etc)
-- only to tags, alarms, and comms devices. Including "io" would only give
the model more surface area to hallucinate an invalid binding from, for
zero benefit.

RULES (violating any of these makes the spec unusable):
- Output ONLY a JSON object. No prose, no markdown code fences, no explanation.
- Every component's binding fields (bind_tag, bind_alarms, bind_device, bind_asset) must all
  be present in your output, but exactly ONE of them should be non-null for each component.
  Set the other three to null.
- alarm_banner components must use bind_alarms (a list of alarm ids). Never bind_tag.
- comms_health components must use bind_device (a device name from the context's comms list).
- nav_tile components must use bind_asset. You will rarely need this component.
- status_indicator, gauge, and trend components must use bind_tag (a single tag name).
- Every tag name, alarm id, or device name you reference MUST come from the machine context
  you are given. Never invent one, even if a plausible-sounding name would fit the request.
- permissions.mode must always be "read_only".
- Never include position, coordinate, width, height, color, or font fields. Only priority,
  size_hint, and min_panel control layout, and the renderer computes layout from those --
  not you.
- priority: 1 is most important/urgent. If the request implies urgency (an alarm, a fault),
  that component should get priority 1.
- size_hint: "wide" means the component always takes a full row to itself, on every panel
  size. "compact" means it wants minimal space. "medium" is the default for most components.
- min_panel: set to "medium" only if the component genuinely needs more room than a 7" panel
  offers (e.g. a trend chart). Otherwise use "small" or leave it appropriate for a compact view.
- context_version in your output must exactly match the context_version given to you below.
- screen_id should be a short unique-looking string, e.g. "gen_<short-random-string>".
