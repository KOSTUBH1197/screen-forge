"""
Reliability test for the spec generator, against the REAL LLM.

Runs a fixed list of realistic operator prompts through
generator.generate_and_validate() -- real network calls, real cost, no mocks --
and reports how many produced a valid screen spec and why the rest failed.

Run (from the repo root or from api/):
    python api/reliability_test.py

Needs OPENAI_API_KEY or GROQ_API_KEY in the environment or in api/.env
(gitignored). generator.llm_provider() decides which one is used, and the
report records it. Writes api/reliability_report.json so runs can be diffed.

How retries are counted: generate_and_validate() does not report how many LLM
calls it made, but it accepts llm_fn. We pass a thin wrapper that increments a
counter and then calls the real generator._call_llm unchanged, so the count is
observed, not guessed. 1 call = passed or failed on the first attempt;
2 calls = the internal retry ran.

Rate limits: a provider's per-minute quota (HTTP 429) says nothing about the
model's reliability, so the wrapper waits and re-sends that same call instead
of letting it count as an "llm" failure. Waits are recorded per prompt.
